<h1>Welcome to the IET</h1>
<p>Information institutions have evolved significantly since 
independence, transitioning from traditional repositories of 
knowledge to dynamic centers of information dissemination and 
knowledge creation. This transformation reflects both global 
information trends and India's unique socio-economic needs. 
The development of information institutions in India has been
 closely tied to the nation's broader development goals, with
  significant policy initiatives aimed at establishing and 
  strengthening various information infrastructures. 
  The foundation for India’s information infrastructure was 
  laid in the Constitution itself, emphasizing the fundamental 
  duty to develop scientific temper, humanism, and the spirit
   of inquiry and reform</p>
