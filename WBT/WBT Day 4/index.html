         <h1>"A leader who stood apart"</h1>

        <p id="p1">Ratan Tata was a leader who stood apart in a world often focused on personal gain. As the chairman of Tata
            Group, one of the world’s largest and most respected companies, he never pursued personal wealth. Despite
            overseeing a $100 billion enterprise, his own net worth remained under a billion dollars. For Tata, success
            wasn’t about personal riches; it was about how much he could give back. His true legacy lies in the lives he
            touched, the communities he uplifted, and the values of generosity and responsibility that he instilled in
            the Tata Group.</p>

    <div>
        <h1>A legacy built on service</h1>
        <p id="p2">Ratan Tata may not have accumulated great personal wealth during his lifetime, but today, he is mourned by a
            billion people. His legacy teaches us that true success is not about how much we acquire but about how much
            we give. He showed us that leadership is defined not by what we gain but by how we serve. As I reflect on
            Ratan Tata’s life, I am reminded of the path I, too, wish to follow: to lead with purpose, to use business
            as a tool for good, and to create a legacy that extends far beyond financial success. Ratan Tata
            demonstrated that the true measure of a leader is not in personal accolades or wealth, but in the positive
            impact they leave on the world. He was not just a business icon—he was a beacon of integrity, compassion,
            and humanity. Rest in peace, Ratan. Your legacy will continue to inspire us all, and the world is forever
            grateful for your service.
